# Ticket Booking dApp using Remix, React, Vite, and Tailwind CSS
## Introduction
This is a decentralized application (dApp) built on Ethereum blockchain that allows users to book tickets for events happening around the world. 
The application utilizes Remix as the smart contract development framework, React for the front-end user interface, Vite for a fast build system, and Tailwind CSS for styling.
The ticket booking process is transparent, secure, and tamper-proof as all ticket transactions are recorded on the Ethereum blockchain.

## Features
1. Browse and search for upcoming events.
2. Book tickets for events with transparent pricing.
3. Secure and tamper-proof ticket storage on the Ethereum blockchain.
4. Easy user interface powered by React and styled with Tailwind CSS.

## Prerequisites
Before running the dApp locally, ensure you have the following tools installed:

1. Node.js (v14 or higher)
3. npm (v7 or higher)
4. Remix IDE 
5. MetaMask (Browser extension for interacting with Ethereum blockchain)

## Smart Contract
The smart contract code is located in the contracts folder. It has been developed using Remix and Solidity. The contract handles the creation and management of event tickets, including booking and tracking ticket sales.
